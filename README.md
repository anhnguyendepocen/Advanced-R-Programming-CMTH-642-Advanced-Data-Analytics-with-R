# CMTH-642-Advanced-Data-Analytics-with-R
Here are some of the assignments I did, which includes advanced analysis on USDA nutrient data sets and the Wine Quality data set
- Assignment 1 dealt with removing missing variables and cleaning the USDA Macronutrients, Micronturients datasets. Attached in the folder are the relevant files.
- Assignment 2 used a cleaner version of the USDA data set. In this project, we determine the correlation between variables, apply an ANOVA model, and predict the significance of indepedent values. Furthermore, we answer research questions based on non-parametric statistics. 
- Assignment 3 dealt with the Wine Quality dataset, which can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv. The objective of this assignment was similar to that of the first 2 assignments, with the added task of using the KNN algorithm to predict the quality of wine.
